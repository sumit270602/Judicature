# Service-Based Legal Pricing System - Implementation Plan

## üìã **Analysis & Requirements**

### **Current System Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Existing**: Single `hourlyRate` field for lawyers
- ‚úÖ **Existing**: Practice areas categorization (10 types)
- ‚úÖ **Existing**: Lawyer recommendation system with ChromaDB
- ‚úÖ **Existing**: Case management with types
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Service-specific pricing structure
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Client service browsing interface
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Service-based lawyer discovery

### **Proposed Enhancement:**
Transform from "hourly rate" model to "service-based pricing" model where:
1. **Lawyers** can set prices for specific legal services
2. **Clients** can browse services by category and compare prices
3. **System** matches clients with lawyers based on service needs
4. **Dashboard** shows service-specific analytics and management

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Backend Data Model Enhancement**

#### **1.1 New Legal Services Schema**
```javascript
// New model: LegalService.js
const legalServiceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  lawyer: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  category: { 
    type: String, 
    enum: ['personal_family', 'criminal_property', 'civil_debt', 'corporate_law', 'others'],
    required: true 
  },
  serviceType: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true // e.g., 'divorce', 'property_registration', 'complaint_filing'
  },
  title: { type: String, required: true }, // e.g., "Divorce Case Filing"
  description: { type: String, required: true },
  pricing: {
    type: { type: String, enum: ['fixed', 'hourly', 'range'], required: true },
    amount: { type: Number }, // For fixed pricing
    minAmount: { type: Number }, // For range pricing
    maxAmount: { type: Number }, // For range pricing
    hourlyRate: { type: Number } // For hourly pricing
  },
  duration: { type: String }, // e.g., "2-3 weeks", "1-2 months"
  requirements: [String], // Documents/info needed
  isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true },
  experience: { type: Number }, // Lawyer's experience in this service
  successRate: { type: Number, default: 0 } // Percentage of successful cases
});
```

#### **1.2 Enhanced User Model**
```javascript
// Add to existing User model
serviceOfferings: [{
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'LegalService'
}],
// Keep hourlyRate for backward compatibility
hourlyRate: { type: Number }, // General consultation rate
```

### **Phase 2: Frontend Service Management**

#### **2.1 Lawyer Service Management Component**
```typescript
// LawyerServiceManagement.tsx
interface LegalService {
  id: string;
  category: string;
  serviceType: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  pricing: {
    type: 'fixed' | 'hourly' | 'range';
    amount?: number;
    minAmount?: number;
    maxAmount?: number;
    hourlyRate?: number;
  };
  duration: string;
  requirements: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

#### **2.2 Client Service Discovery Component**
```typescript
// ServiceBrowser.tsx - Client-facing service discovery
interface ServiceCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  services: ServiceListing[];
}

interface ServiceListing {
  lawyer: LawyerProfile;
  service: LegalService;
  rating: number;
  reviewCount: number;
  responseTime: string;
}
```

### **Phase 3: Service Categories Structure**

Based on your screenshot, implement these categories:

```typescript
const SERVICE_CATEGORIES = {
  personal_family: {
    name: "Personal / Family",
    services: [
      "divorce",
      "family_dispute", 
      "child_custody",
      "muslim_law",
      "medical_negligence",
      "motor_accident"
    ]
  },
  criminal_property: {
    name: "Criminal / Property",
    services: [
      "criminal_case",
      "property_dispute",
      "landlord_tenant",
      "cyber_crime",
      "wills_trusts",
      "labour_service"
    ]
  },
  civil_debt: {
    name: "Civil / Debt Matters",
    services: [
      "documentation",
      "consumer_court",
      "civil_case",
      "cheque_bounce",
      "recovery"
    ]
  },
  corporate_law: {
    name: "Corporate Law",
    services: [
      "arbitration",
      "trademark_copyright",
      "customs_excise",
      "startup_legal",
      "banking_finance",
      "gst_matters",
      "corporate_compliance"
    ]
  },
  others: {
    name: "Others",
    services: [
      "armed_forces_tribunal",
      "supreme_court",
      "insurance_claims",
      "immigration",
      "international_law"
    ]
  }
};
```

## üé® **UI/UX Design Strategy**

### **Lawyer Dashboard Enhancement:**
1. **Add "Services & Pricing" tab** to existing lawyer dashboard
2. **Service management interface** - add/edit/deactivate services
3. **Service performance analytics** - bookings, revenue per service
4. **Pricing optimization suggestions** based on market rates

### **Client Service Discovery:**
1. **Category-based browsing** matching your screenshot layout
2. **Service comparison table** with lawyer profiles and prices
3. **Filter & sort functionality** by price, rating, experience
4. **"Talk to a Lawyer" integration** with service pre-selection

### **Enhanced Case Creation:**
1. **Service-based case creation** instead of general case creation
2. **Automatic lawyer matching** based on selected service
3. **Price transparency** before lawyer selection
4. **Service-specific requirements** collection
